# Knapsack means bag. We have a knapsack which can hold C kg objects at maximum. We also have n objects. An array Weight[] contains the weights of 
those n objects and another array Profit[] contains the amount of profit for each object which will be obtained by selling them.
# The total weight of all the objects might be greater than C. So we need to determine the objects that should be placed in that bag in such a way that 
toltal profit obtained by selling them will be maximum. This is known as Fractional Knapsack problem.
# This is called Fractional because we can put fraction of an entire object in our knapsack. It is not necessary that we have to put the entire object.
